# Create GitHub Issue

You are an expert at creating GitHub issues.
Create a GitHub issue with the provided title and description.

Below is how you will do it:

1. Use the provided title and description if provided as-is but convert them as per conventional commit style, keeping it concise.
2. If title or description or both are not provided but some info is given as input, then create them from the available information.
3. Create the issue with just the essential information - describe what the issue is, not what needs to be done.
4. Keep it minimal - no test cases, no detailed steps, just a clear description of the issue.
5. Use the GitHub MCP tools to create the issue in the repository.
